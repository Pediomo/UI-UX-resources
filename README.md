> The ‚ÄúUI‚Äù in UI design stands for ‚Äúuser interface.‚Äù The user interface is the graphical layout of an application, while the ‚ÄúUX‚Äù stands for ‚Äúuser experience.‚Äù A user‚Äôs experience of the app is determined by how they interact with it. ~ [UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/what-is-ui-vs-ux-design-and-the-difference-d9113f6612de)
